# IRS Scams 

This dataset seems appealing and interesting to me as it shows data about scams related to IRS which would be great for analysis to know the most scammed area,means of scams etc. 

## Data
There are approximately 15000 records of complaints in the dataset comprising of 9 columns. Few of the columns are 'Reference Number', 'created Date', 'consumer address'. 

## License
As per John Templon, BuzzFeed News reporter, the data is obtained from the FTC via a Freedom of Information Act request.

- [data/FTC_2011-43014.csv](data/FTC_2011-43014.csv): All complaints to the Federal Trade Commission that mention IRS in the complaint. The data was received via a Freedom of Information Request. This is the first half of the data, which contains all complaints from January 1, 2011 through April 30, 2014.

- [data/FTC_5114-71014.csv](data/FTC_5114-71014.csv): All complaints to the Federal Trade Commission that mention IRS in the complaint. The data was received via a Freedom of Information Request. This is the second half of the data, which contains all complaints from May 1, 2014 through July 10, 2014 â€” the data the FTC received the FOIA request.

## Potential data users

The potential users of data can be the FTC itself to build on security measures and data breach response for business.
